# 'Collectron' aka "Der SammlerBlog"

Another amazing project blowing the minds of millions of users!

Built by two superheros born in a universe where cats can swim and dogs can fly! 

Here are some hints to get the full pleasure as user. Enjoy! Please don't take this to seriuosly.

1.Choose your database:

Within the application.properties in the backend resources, you can switch form H2 to MySQL to use your own database for long term use.

The H2 database is set per default. This is just for demonstration.

Name your SQL database "db_collectron"! You can set the URL and password in the apllciation.properties.

2.Starting the backend:

Before starting the backend with spring bootstrap service, please clean your Maven and refresh the dependencies.

3.Starting the frontend:

The frontend is built with Angular cli. Please run 'npm install' before use!

4.Enjoy the site! Thx for feedback!
